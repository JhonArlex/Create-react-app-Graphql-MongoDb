# Contributing Guide Lines
Hey welcome to this project, and thanks for trying to contribute to the open source cause. This project is a little starter kit I wanted to release to the public for anyone who wanted to you use this stack and decided that maybe hacktober wouuld be a great time to ask for some help.

I'll be checking PR's on the daily.

Feel free to submit PR's for code clean up- I perfer small PR's that refactor one thing at a time.

The project was a personal project and I know could use some work - If you have any other issues feel free to PM me and I'll make an issue out of it.

Thanks!
