# Contributing Guide Lines
Hey welcome to this project, and thanks for trying to contribute to the open source cause. This project is a little starter kit I wanted to release to the public for anyone who wanted to you use this stack and decided that maybe hacktober wouuld be a great time to ask for some help.

## I'll be checking PR's on the daily - I don't expect to see too may since hacktoberfest has been well underway for about a 2 weeks or so. 

## Feel free to PM me if you want your PR looked at asap!

The project was a personal project and I know could use some work - If you have any other issues feel free to PM me and I'll make an issue out of it.

Thanks!
